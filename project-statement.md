### Approach

### Product to be handed in

## Project agreement guidelines

* What is the title of the project?
* Problem statement. Consider the following:
  * To identify, define and delimit a problem within information technology.
  * To identify and analyse relevant means for solving the problem, such as academic theories, methods, literature,
    tools and other sources, as well as existing solutions to the problem.
  * To combine the selected means, develop them further if necessary, and apply them in a concerted effort towards the
    solution of the problem.
  * To evaluate the achieved solution.
  * To report in a coherent and stringent way the problem, the background research, the work towards the solution, the
    achieved solution, the evaluation, and other relevant material, while adhering to the academic standards.
  * To reflect upon the problem, the chosen approach, the achieved solution, and other findings.
* Approach
  * Which activities you plan to implement to carry out the project, for
    instance study of literature, collecting and working up empirical data, development
    and test of prototype or production etc.
* Product to be handed in
  * Describe what you intend to upload.
  * Type of examination (Group exam)
* Practicalities (not necessarily required)
  * When will we work?
  * Where will we work?
  * When should we aim to be done with the project?
